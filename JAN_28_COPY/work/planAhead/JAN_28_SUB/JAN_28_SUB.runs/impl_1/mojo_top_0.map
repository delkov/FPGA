WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net main_control/state_q[0] is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   162 out of   1,430   11%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        88 out of   2,860    3%

      to control set restrictions:              75 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
