Clock Signal                       | Clock buffer(FF name)        | Load  |
-----------------------------------+------------------------------+-------+

INFO:Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
